Data associated with the manuscript titled:
<br>
<strong>&quot;Index and biological spectrum of accessible DNA elements in the human genome&quot;</strong>
<br>
Meuleman <em>et al.</em>
<br><br>

<strong>1. DHS Index</strong>
<br>
An index of DNase I Hypersensitive Sites (DHSs) in the human genome, 
<br>
Elements were delineated across 733 biosamples and annotated
(<strong><em>Figure panel a</em></strong>).
<br>
Each DHS is associated with a confidence score&nbsp;based on mean DNase I signal strength across accessible biosamples.
<br>
<br>
Scores in the manuscript and original data range from 0 to ~2 (95th percentile).
<br>
However, to be compatible with the UCSC browser, scores are scaled to a maximum of 1000 and rounded to the nearest integer.
<br>
Therefore, when choosing a score threshold at the top of this page, keep in mind that a score of e.g. 500 corresponds to an original score of 1
(<strong><em>Figure panel b</em></strong>).
<br>
<br>

<strong>2. DHS Vocabulary</strong>
<br>
A simple vocabulary capturing complex cross-dataset patterning of DHSs.
<br>
This vocabulary was obtained by decomposing DHS patterns across 733 datasets into 
16 components using Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF).
<br>
Each DHS is colored according to its dominant component (<strong>Figure panel c</strong>).
