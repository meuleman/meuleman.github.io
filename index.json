We created deep reference maps of DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) from 733 human biosamples encompassing 439 cell and tissue types and states, and integrated these to delineate and numerically index ~3.6 million DHSs encoded within the human genome, providing a common coordinate system for regulatory DNA.\nWe find that the scale of cell and tissue states sampled exposes a large degree of stereotyped actuation of large sets of elements, signaling the operation of distinct genome-scale regulatory programs. These actuation patterns of individual elements can be captured comprehensively by a simple regulatory vocabulary reflecting their dominant program. This vocabulary, in turn, enables regulatory annotation of both protein-coding genes and the vast array of well-defined but poorly-characterized non-coding RNA genes.\nFinally, we find that regulatory vocabularies open new avenues for systematically interpreting non-coding genetic variation, and substantially empower the connection of disease-associated variation with specific cell and tissue states.\nTaken together, our results provide a common and extensible coordinate system and vocabulary for human regulatory DNA, and open a new global perspective on the architecture of human gene regulation.\nMaterial available for download:\n  DHS Index and Vocabulary of ~3.6M DHSs ( tsv, hg38)\n   Column Example Description     seqname chr1 Chromosome   start 1782520 Start position   end 1782770 End position   identifier 1.10643 Unique identifier (chr#.position%)   mean_signal 1.030869481 Mean DNase-seq signal per biosample (\u0026ldquo;confidence score\u0026rdquo;)   numsamples 54 Number of biosamples with a DHS   summit 1782650 Estimated DHS summit position   core_start 1782590 Start position of core-region   core_end 1782710 End position of core-region   component Digestive Main DHS Vocabulary component      733 biosample metadata ( html, pdf, tsv, xlsx, Google spreadsheet)\n  DHS-by-biosample matrices\nRows correspond to DHS Index elements, columns correspond to rows in biosample metadata (both in order).\n Presence/absence matrix ( R sparse Matrix format, Matrix Market format, raw text format) Signal matrix ( R sparse Matrix format, raw text format)     Meuleman et al., bioRxiv (2019)\nWork with Sasha Muratov, John Stamatoyannopoulos and others.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583390468,"objectID":"8b7b6eb8f023ae81d0cd89cabb4116a3","permalink":"https://www.meuleman.org/research/dhsindex/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/dhsindex/","section":"research","summary":"Chromatin accessibility patterns across 700+ biosamples","tags":null,"title":"Annotated regulatory Index","type":"research"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"DNA is organized in the cell nucleus by way of a chromatin structure, which is shaped and maintained by many chromatin marks, such as histone tail modifications (e.g., H3K4me1), transcription factors (e.g., GATA1) and chromatin modifiers (e.g., EZH2).
