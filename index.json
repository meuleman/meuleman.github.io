Endogenously, such control is achieved by way of regulatory elements such as promoters, enhancers and insulators. One of the main hallmarks of such elements is their accessibility to factors promoting transcription of cognate genes. To achieve cellular programming through the manipulation of regulatory elements, it is therefore desirable to dictate the accessibility patterns of elements across cellular conditions of interest.\nWe propose a fully data-driven framework for designing synthetic human sequence elements with predicted cell-context specific chromatin accessibility behavior. We apply a comprehensively annotated high-resolution map of accessible genomic elements as the basis for a training set to learn and apply the foundational rules regarding how regulatory elements are encoded in the human genome. This approach results in highly variable pools of synthetic sequences, not observed in nature.\nWe use a supervised adaptation strategy to evolve these sequences towards multiple pre-defined cellular contexts. We show that this tuning process not only retains characteristics of endogenous regulatory sequences, but often strengthens them through an increased abundance of relevant regulatory signals.\nOur approach and its current results provide a foundation for subsequent experimental validation through the targeted integration of synthetic sequences in genomic loci in relevant cellular conditions.\nWork with Peter Bromley\nMaterial available for download Code base All code is available on GitHub\nCurated chromatin accessibility datasets For this project we make use of a dataset of chromatin accessibility obtained across 733 human biosamples, containing more than 3.5 million DNase Hypersensitive Sites (DHSs). These data were previously published (paper) and are available here.\nAn important aspect of these data is an annotation of accessibile elements in terms of 16 components, each corresponding to a different cellular context (e.g. ‘cardiac’, ’neural’, ’lymphoid’):\nTo aid in efforts towards understanding and generating regulatory sequences, we curated a subset of these data and provide it to the wider community. This subset consists of fixed-length 200bp sequences selected from the total collection of 3.5M+ sequences based on their accessibility confidence level and relative specificity for individual DHS components.\nSpecifically, we have the following datasets available:\ntraining set: 160k sequences, 10k per NMF component (.csv.gz) validation set: 16k sequences, 1k per NMF component (.csv.gz) test set: 16k sequences, 1k per NMF component (.csv.gz) Each of these contains the genomic locations (human genome assembly hg38, first 3 columns) of accessible genome elements, their majority NMF component (column: component, see legend figure above) as well as their 200bp nucleotide sequence (column: raw_sequence).\nColumn Example Description seqname chr16 Chromosome start 68843660 Start position end 68843880 End position DHS_width 220 Width of original DHS summit 68843790 Position of center of mass of DHS total_signal 122.770678 Sum of DNase-seq signal across biosamples numsamples 61 Number of biosamples with the DHS raw_sequence GAGGCATTG… 200bp extracted nucleotide sequence component 1 Dominant DHS Vocabulary component proportion 0.767371514 Proportion of NMF loadings in this component Please refer to the DHS Index project page for more information and details on the full dataset.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1665172997,"objectID":"f4aaa736575aadf6e82272ad5c7f49b6","permalink":"https://www.meuleman.org/research/synthseqs/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/synthseqs/","section":"research","summary":"Data-driven design of context-specific regulatory elements","tags":null,"title":"Synthetic DNA sequences","type":"research"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) are generic markers of regulatory DNA and contain genetic variations associated with diseases and phenotypic traits. We created high-resolution maps of DHSs from 733 human biosamples encompassing 438 cell and tissue types and states, and integrated these to delineate and numerically index approximately 3.6 million DHSs within the human genome sequence, providing a common coordinate system for regulatory DNA.\nHere we show that these maps highly resolve the cis-regulatory compartment of the human genome, which encodes unexpectedly diverse cell- and tissue-selective regulatory programs at very high density. These programs can be captured comprehensively by a simple vocabulary that enables the assignment to each DHS of a regulatory barcode that encapsulates its tissue manifestations, and global annotation of protein-coding and non-coding RNA genes in a manner orthogonal to gene expression.\nFinally, we show that sharply resolved DHSs markedly enhance the genetic association and heritability signals of diseases and traits. Rather than being confined to a small number of distal elements or promoters, we find that genetic signals converge on congruently regulated sets of DHSs that decorate entire gene bodies. Together, our results create a universal, extensible coordinate system and vocabulary for human regulatory DNA marked by DHSs, and provide a new global perspective on the architecture of human gene regulation.\nMeuleman et al., Nature (2020)\nWork with Sasha Muratov, John Stamatoyannopoulos and others.\nMaterial available for download DHS Index and Vocabulary of ~3.6M DHSs (tsv, hg38)\nColumn Example Description seqname chr1 Chromosome start 1782520 Start position end 1782770 End position identifier 1.10643 Unique identifier (chr#.position%) mean_signal 1.030869481 Mean DNase-seq signal per biosample (“confidence score”) numsamples 54 Number of biosamples with a DHS summit 1782650 Estimated DHS summit position core_start 1782590 Start position of core-region core_end 1782710 End position of core-region component Digestive Main DHS Vocabulary component Data browsers (Altius browser, UCSC browser tracks)\n733 biosample metadata (html, pdf, tsv, xlsx, Google spreadsheet)\nDHS-by-biosample matrices\nRows correspond to DHS Index elements, columns correspond to rows in biosample metadata (both in order).\nPresence/absence matrix (R sparse Matrix format, Matrix Market format, raw text format) Signal matrix (R sparse Matrix format, raw text format) Per-biosample and per-component data\nDHS Index elements found in specific biosamples:\nColumn `biosample_signal` reports the normalized DNase-seq signal for the individual biosample.\nDHS Index elements annotated with specific DHS components:\nBy default, each DHS is annotated with a single (dominant) component only.

Between February 28th and April 12th, the figures below got regenerated on a daily basis. Many superior efforts have emerged since, and this website will no longer be updated. Percentage of population that are confirmed cases (First version: Feb 28, 2020)\nThe top 20 countries in terms of percentage of the population confirmed to be affected by the COVID-19 coronavirus are shown below1, along with a world-wide average. Percent of per-country population confirmed to be COVID-19 cases, shown for the top 20 countries and world-wide. Percentages shown on the right are for the most recent date indicated. Due to the exponential nature of these numbers, data are shown on a linear (a) and logarithmic (b) scale. COVID-19 cases are severely underreported due to limited testing and as such these numbers are likely extreme underestimates.\nYet, the shape of these curves might provide meaningful information about different patterns of viral infection progression and containment between countries, in particular when multiple countries show similar patterns.\nDaily growth of newly confirmed cases (First version: Mar 12, 2020)\nMore relevant than the number of confirmed cases – or percentage of population affected – is how fast the virus spreads. One way to visualize this is to estimate the slope of the exponential curves (Figure 1b) over set time intervals and derive the daily percental increase of newly confirmed cases2. Percent daily growth of newly confirmed cases, estimated using intervals of the 10 previous days. Panel on the right shows highest and current growth numbers, including 95% confidence interval ranges. It is important to emphasize that over the course of time many countries have revised their testing strategies, which will artificially influence these growth numbers.\nPercentage of population that has died of COVID-19 (First version: Mar 26, 2020)\nBy the end of March, the number of deaths from COVID-19 had risen to a level that made it possible to show growth curves in a similar manner as done for confirmed cases above. The number of deaths from COVID-19 is arguably a more reliable metric for population-wide impact, as it suffers less from the absence of systematic and/or asymptomatic testing.\nThe top 20 countries in terms of percentage of the population that has died from of COVID-19 are shown below3, along with a world-wide average. Percent of per-country population that has died of COVID-19, shown for the top 20 countries and world-wide. Percentages shown on the right are for the most recent date indicated. Due to the exponential nature of these numbers, data are shown on a linear (a) and logarithmic (b) scale. It’ll be interesting, and generally disheartening, to see how these figures evolve over the coming weeks and months.\nMore figures and details are available at this GitHub repository.\nBackground The outbreak of the COVID-19 corona virus prompted an impressively rapid and joint response of epidemiologists, geneticists, software developers and data analysts. This has resulted in a number of insightful web-based dashboard tools to track and better understand the movements of this virus for specific regions, countries and throughout the world4: One of the more comprehensive instances in terms of world-wide coverage is a dashboard provided by Johns Hopkins University (JHU), displaying counts of confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries: Map view of the COVID-19 dashboard provided by the Johns Hopkins University What struck me about these dashboards is that although they provide reports on the absolute number of cases identified – some even provide in-depth information on individual cases – they lack a population-wide context. In particular, I wanted to know what these numbers meant in terms of the fraction of (per-country) populations affected.\nApproach Normalizing the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases per country with per-country population estimates requires two things: 1) the numbers behind these dashboards and 2) estimates of per-country population counts.\nLuckily the folks at JHU have freely made available their meticulously curated datasets, which they continue to update on a daily basis. And the World Bank provides population count estimates for over 250 countries world-wide.\nCombined5, these datasets open up an alternative view of the COVID-19 situation, in terms of the percentage of per-country populations (confirmed to be) affected by the virus. All code, data and resulting figures are available through this GitHub repository, and are updated on a near-daily basis.\nTo prevent highly unstable percentages, currently included countries have a minimum of 100 cases and a population of at least 100000. ↩︎\nEstimates are based on 10 day intervals.

The genome-wide occurrence of such chromatin marks can be captured using assays such as Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (ChIP-Seq). Chromatin states describe the combinatorial occurrence of multiple chromatin marks, defined using software such as ChromHMM and Segway.\nChromatin states across 100s of biosamples can capture the dynamics of chromatin marks. Although this provides clues to the function of genomic regions, it results in large datasets that remain hard to navigate.\nBy modeling the information content, we transform multi-biosample chromatin state data into intuitive readouts called epilogos.
