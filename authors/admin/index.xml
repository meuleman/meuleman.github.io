      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wouter Meuleman&amp;rsquo;s research focuses on the organization and layout of regulatory elements of the human genome and their relation to cellular state and gene regulation.
Although technological developments have made it possible to construct genome-wide maps of such regulatory elements across hundreds of human cell states, the scale and complexity precludes routine utility of such maps.
Wouter develops computational and machine learning approaches to exploit such data, by reducing their complexity while maximally retaining relevant information.
Wouter&amp;rsquo;s work aims to construct descriptive, predictive and interpretable models of cellular state and gene regulation.
Prior to joining Altius, Wouter did postdoctoral work at MIT and the Broad Institute.
He obtained his PhD in Computational Biology from Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
