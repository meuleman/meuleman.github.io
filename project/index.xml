      <title>Annotated regulatory Index</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Regulatory information encoded in the human genome is activated by sequence-specific DNA binding factors,
creating focal alterations in chromatin structure that are hypersensitive to DNase I.
We created deep reference maps of DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) from
733 human biosamples encompassing 439 cell and tissue types and states,
and integrated these to delineate and numerically index ~3.6 million DHSs encoded within the human genome,
providing a common coordinate system for regulatory DNA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We find that the scale of cell and tissue states sampled exposes
a large degree of stereotyped actuation of large sets of elements,
signaling the operation of distinct genome-scale regulatory programs.
These actuation patterns of individual elements can be captured comprehensively
by a simple regulatory vocabulary reflecting their dominant program.
This vocabulary, in turn, enables regulatory annotation of both protein-coding genes
and the vast array of well-defined but poorly-characterized non-coding RNA genes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we find that regulatory vocabularies open new avenues for systematically
interpreting non-coding genetic variation, and substantially empower the
connection of disease-associated variation with specific cell and tissue states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, our results provide a common and extensible coordinate system and vocabulary
for human regulatory DNA, and open a new global perspective on the architecture of human gene regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Data saliency Ôºç epilogos</title>
      <link>https://www.meuleman.org/project/epilogos/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DNA is organized in the cell nucleus by way of a chromatin structure, which is shaped and maintained by many chromatin marks, such as histone tail modifications (e.g., H3K4me1), transcription factors (e.g., GATA1) and chromatin modifiers (e.g., EZH2).
The genome-wide occurrence of such chromatin marks can be captured using assays such as Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (ChIP-Seq).
Chromatin states describe the combinatorial occurrence of multiple chromatin marks, defined using software such as ChromHMM and Segway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chromatin states across 100s of biosamples can capture the dynamics of chromatin marks.
Although this provides clues to the function of genomic regions, it results in large datasets that remain hard to navigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By modeling the information content, we transform multi-biosample chromatin state data into intuitive readouts called epilogos.
This process is analogous to how motif logos are derived from DNA or protein sequence alignments, and opens up new possibilities for studying chromatin mark dynamics in large genome-wide datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.epilogos.net&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Start using epilogos now!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chromatin state maps</title>
      <link>https://www.meuleman.org/project/roadmap/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The reference human genome sequence set the stage for studies of genetic variation and its association with human disease, but up until 2015 epigenomic studies lacked a similar reference.
To address this need, we generated the largest collection of human epigenomes for primary cells and tissues to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We performed an integrative analysis of 111 reference human epigenomes generated as part of the programme,
profiled for histone modification patterns, DNA accessibility, DNA methylation and RNA expression.
Focusing on histone tail modifications, we defined extensive chromatin state models and maps.
By integrating these maps with chromatin accessibility data obtained from DNase-seq experiments, we established global maps of regulatory elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We showed that disease- and trait-associated genetic variation is preferentially localized in tissue-specific regulatory elements,
revealing biologically relevant cell types for diverse human traits, and providing a resource for interpreting the molecular basis of human disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, our results demonstrated the central role of epigenomic information for understanding gene regulation, cellular differentiation and human disease.

      <title>Lamina Associated Domains</title>
      <link>https://www.meuleman.org/project/lamina/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By studying which regions of the human genome come into contact with the nuclear periphery,
we demonstrated that the genome is divided into large, discrete domains.
These domains are units of chromosome organisation within the nucleus, and we named them Lamina Associated Domains (LADs).
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: right&#34;&gt;
(Guelen &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Nature&lt;/strong&gt; (2008))
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better understand the (re)organization of the genome through cell differentiation, we extended our study to a mouse differentiation model.
By studying the dynamics during differentiation, we found that lamina-genome interactions are widely involved in the
control of gene expression programs during lineage commitment and terminal differentiation.
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: right&#34;&gt;
(Peric-Hupkes, Meuleman &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Mol. Cell&lt;/strong&gt; (2010))
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these dynamics, we find that the majority of lamina-genome interactions are constitutive across cell types.
Moreover, the genome-wide patterning of constitutive LADs is highly conserved between human and mouse,
and can be largely predicted based on DNA sequence content only.
This suggests that LADs collectively encode a basic `backbone&amp;rsquo; structure for organizing chromosomes.
